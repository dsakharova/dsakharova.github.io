            <strong>My role:</strong> As an end-to-end designer, I worked on on every aspect of the product development process. I was responsible for defining the problem, brainstorming with other team members on the solution, creating wireframes, organizing visual data, creating interaction, doing some visual design, prototyping, coding HTML & CSS and making the site responsive. I worked closely with the engineering team and a product manager to move the project forward and participated in customer meetings with the school's Provosts and CFO's.

      <div class="large-12 columns">
        <p>
          <strong>The Business Challenge:</strong> When coming up with a flat fee for students, the schools had to estimate how much they should charge their students. The schools did not have a simple way to view the cost breakdown of their adopted books, nor could they find a way to reduce the cost easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The User Challenge:</strong> We had lots of data that we could show, but the user wanted to see relevant data without being overwhelmed. The user wanted an easy way to reduce the cost of the adopted books.

        2. Explore solutions
      </h4>
      <div class="large-12 columns">
        <p>
          In our research phase, we interviewed our schools’ provosts and CFOs about their current process for determining their content prices. We collected and analyzed the schools’ textbook adoptions data. We held brainstorm sessions, tried to find analogy products, and created personas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The analogy products that we came up was FICO scores (credit karma). We wanted to rate each book and how the school is doing similar to the credit scores. The scores impacted the cost of the materials and how the schools are going to pay for their signed contract.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also thought that comparing cars was a good analogy for the cost analysis that we can provide for our customers. We already had a dashboard where we showed the schools their guardrails and how they are doing historically. But we could show more relevant information for them.

          I decided to make sketches for the initial wireframes. I wanted to capture what kind of data we wanted to show to the user and have an idea of how to organize and reveal the information architecture.

Each module would go the pages or information presented on the diagram.

            After wireframe critique and discussions, I created these medium-fidelity mock-ups. I decided to create a more fleshed out mockups because we had a component library and style guide that I could reuse, which allowed me to prototype quickly based on the original sketch wireframes. In this stage, I explored the type of graphs and kind of data we wanted to reveal to the users. The mocks allowed us to have more discussions about information organization and what to show to the user.

            Unfortunately, the funding was pulled away from the project, and we never launched this product. Nonetheless, this was an excellent experience for me to design for top-level managers - schools' CFO's and Provosts. I enjoyed learning what our top-level clients were looking for in the product and creating a tailored experience that would solve their problems. If we continued building this app, my next steps would be to complete a round of user testing, fix bugs and streamline the user experience.

          We knew that we wanted to show as much relevant information as possible for our clients. To explore ideas, I created a mood board of a different variety of graphs we can have on the page. I had to have discussions with the project managers to see what the clients guardrails in the contracts and I had to talk to the engineers to see what kind of data is available and we can show to the clients. After I had the requirements and data, I started designing and organizing information. The look and feel of the design also had to be similar to the styles of the website.

            Although working with graph libraries reduced the development time, there are some challenges and drawbacks, which include lack of leeway to style the graphs or change the animations, not that many variations of charts and graphs to choose from.

          <strong>The User Challenge:</strong> The engineers ignored the errors because (1) they were unreadable and (2) they were too many of them, and (3) they looked all the same, and there wasn't a way to differentiate them. The user wanted a better way to view and manage the errors.

Although we did a lot of whiteboard brainstorming as a team, I didn't take pictures of that stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to organizing the error emails and creating a more readable format, we decided that we wanted to have a separate webpage where the engineers can view and explore the error, and assign themselves as the owner of the group of errors for a particular bug.

          <p class="push-bottom">
            Notifier project is one of my favorite projects I worked on because the users were easily reachable (they were our company's engineers) and I could talk and interview them without any hindrances. The turnaround of the project was quick, about a month, but because we worked with an offshore team, the progress of the project was phenomenal. The best part was receiving feedback on how this solution simplified and improved each engineer's life. That felt priceless.

            The Manage and Receive Inventory applications allow the schools to keep track of their book inventory. After receiving a pallet of books, each book is scanned individually into the inventory management system. The receiving app scans hundreds of books per hour using an ISBN scanner, and a separate inventory management application gives the school administrators a way to view and track each book, as well as correct any possible mistakes with the inventory.

              The Receive Inventory app works together with the Inventory Management app. When schools receive shipped book pallets, the users individually entered each book into the inventory system by scanning the barcode on the back of the book; this allows them to track each book later. Receive Inventory app allows the users to scan hundreds of books while minimizing errors efficiently.

              Both Manage Inventory and Receive Inventory apps went through various iterations and changes. The bundle was an essential part of the contract suite our company sold to our clients. The app had to work with book scanners, which brought on interesting challenges when designing the interactions. I did a significant amount of user testing to improve the performance of the apps with and without the book scanner.

          The Process
        </h2>
        <h4 class="uppercase">
          1. Define the problem
        </h4>
        <p>
          <strong>The Business Challenge:</strong> For the managing inventory application, the challenge was to find a better way to track books - how many books, which ones are checked out by the students, and monitor errors in inventory. For the receiving inventory application, the challenge was to increase the efficiency of scanning each book with a negligible amount of mistakes as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The User Challenge:</strong> For the managing inventory application, the user challenge was to have intuitive UI (reduce user errors) and show revenant information depending on the particular tasks and issues. For the receiving inventory application, the user challenge was to make receiving hundreds of books easier, make it enjoyable (fun) activity and minimize any frustration, and reduce user error. Also, the primary challenge for both of the apps, and especially the Receiving app, was to integrate a scanner with the UI.
        </p>

        <h4 class="uppercase">
          2. Explore solutions
        </h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Manage Inventory:</strong> When brainstorming the solutions, we realized that there are already many solutions available on the market that manages inventory. We liked Shopify's user experience and interaction of the app, and we took much inspiration from that design.
        </p><img src="images/design-process/IMS-Receiving-Process/shopify-example.png" width="971" height="203" alt="Shopify Example">
        <p class="box">
          We liked this interaction from Shopify. It allowed to add/set items for each item, and it also showed a preview when changing the number.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Receive Inventory:</strong> In our old system, we had a similar application that allowed users to receive books, but it was clunky and frustrating (the frustration came from constantly switching between a scanner and mouse/keyboard interaction). We decided to glean some interactions from the app, but we wanted the application to be more efficient and easier to use. One of the primary requirement was to allow the user to keep using the scanner without touching the keyboard or mouse.
        </p>
        <h4 class="uppercase">
          3. Early Sketches / Wireframes
        </h4>
        <p>
          The manage inventory and receiving applications were part of our Rafter360 bundle product. As you can see below, they were part of the inventory bundle responsible for managing and correcting the clients' book inventory. Both of the products were separate apps in the system, but they communicated with many other apps.

              This is an initial wireframe I did for Inventory Management System (IMS). Initially, IMS was responsible for receiving and managing each school's book inventory. But after a short period, we branched out from IMS and built a separate app that was responsible solely for receiving inventory into the system.

        <p>
          This is one of the wireframes I did for the receiving inventory app. We wanted the user to record the box number before receiving any items, so we have a record of the data. The user would use the scanner to input each ISBN into the system. And, it was important that the cursor was in the right position (e.g., in the search box), when the user entered the app.

        User Testing

        I did several rounds of user testing for both inventory management and receiving applications. Inventory management was built first and only after we a good round of user testing, we decided to create a separate app for receiving with the purpose of receiving hundreds of books in an hour.

      <p>
        You can read a sample of the inventory management test <a href="images/design-process/IMS-Receiving-Process/IMS-User-Testing.pdf">here</a>. One significant change that we did after user testing is adding a radio button option for add/set interaction. Many users were confused which button was the active one when toggling between add and set functions. Adding a "like" radio button graphic to the group buttons, fixed that issue.

        <p>
          Both of the management inventory and receiving application were an integral part of managing our clients' book inventory. In addition to user testing, I had to do several dry runs of the system where I tested vulnerability and interactions of each application within the product bundle. By doing the tests, we could see if where they are possible issues with the system and how the users interacted with each application.

            When designing the application UI with an external devices, e.g. scanners, we had a lot of challenges when the user was scanning an item, but the barcodes didn't scan incorrectly. To correct various scan issues, we created pop up errors accompanied by a "beep" sound to draw attention to the screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before I created these interactions, I did multiple user testing with users performing tasks on the computer and using the scanners. The user testing allowed me to see how the users interact with the scanner and the UI. It also allowed me to test and validate the text that made the most sense to the user.

I had to do extensive user testing to test the interactivity of the app and see where the users run into errors when using the scanners. After that, I created and designed the popups and continued to user test them to see if they prevented and reverted the errors. My responsibility included gather requirements from user testing, creating wireframes, prototyping (with HTML and CSS), doing the illustrations, and coding responsive versions of the popups.

            After doing user testing and tweaking the wording, I decided to add a checkbox, which unlocked the "confirm" button, which allowed the user to acknowledge that he or she read the text and prevented the automatic response of clicking the blue button. Additionally, I wanted to differentiate these popups from regular system errors, and that is why the heading says "warning" instead of "error." And, I used a pink color instead of red to minimize any panic a user might feel when the pop-up appears, but at the same time, it still grabs attention. We implimented the final version after user testing it and getting the correct results, i.e. the user understanding and correcting the behavior without any issues.

            User testing was an essential design process in this project because it allowed us to clean up the messaging of the notification and make it understandable to the user. After user testing, we realized that we also need to add a "beep" sound when the pop up appears, because when the users were using a scanner, they were distracted and were not looking at the screen. Without user testing, these kind of errors would not have been successful in correcting and preventing future user errors.
